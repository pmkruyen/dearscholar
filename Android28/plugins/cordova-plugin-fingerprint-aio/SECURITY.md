# Security Policy

>This is side project of me. I only work on it on my free time. I try to do my best to keep this project working securely but I cannot guarantee any stability and security fixes or fixes for future OS version. Please consider the steps below before publishing security related bugs.

## Supported Versions

The latest version of the plugin is the only supported version right now. This might change if breaking changes (like a version 2) is introduced.

The only supported iOS version is the latest stable release. The most used Android versions are covered under a best effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you encounter any security related issues please contact me via the e-mail from my [Github](https://github.com/niklasmerz) profile before publishing it. Just hit me up that you have found a bug. You should use PGP if you want to send sensible information to me but I would prefer to use the Github tools. I will add you to the private discussion to go into detail. 

I will create a new security advisory as soon as possible. Security advisories allow us to discuss the issue privatly and work on a solution before releasing any details.

Keybase is another secure channel: https://keybase.io/niklasmerz
