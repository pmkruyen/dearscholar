# Overview
Because collecting longitudinal data becomes more important in academic research nowadays and because limitations with available tools, DearScholar has been developed.

DearScholar allows researchers to easily and orderly collect rich and diverse qualitative and quantitative data over short and long periods of time to answer research questions about inter- and intra-individual changes, developments, and processes.

## Your own version of DearScholar?
Obviously, as this is an open-source project, you are free to build your own derivative version (clone) of DearScholar. While DearScholar clones might be allowed on Google Play, submisions of clones are likely to be rejected on the App Store.
