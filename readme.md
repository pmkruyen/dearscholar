# Overview
Because collecting longitudinal data becomes more important in academic research nowadays and because limitations with available tools, DearScholar has been developed.

DearScholar allows researchers to easily and orderly collect rich and diverse qualitative and quantitative data over short and long periods of time to answer research questions about inter- and intra-individual changes, developments, and processes.

Developed as hybrid app in Cordova/Phonegap (using html, javascript, and css), DearScholar can be used to collect data on iOS devices (iPhones and iPads), Android devices, and--in the future--in web browsers too.

This document provides general information about the app, including an overview of current features. The [Wiki section](https://github.com/pmkruyen/dearscholar/wiki) provides installation instructions, settings and options, and other details for academic researchers who consider using DearScholar to collect data *and* potential contributors who want to help to improve DearScholar. Background information, an summary of the current features, and current research projects can be found on the [project page](https://peterkruyen.net/dearscholar.html).

## Interested in using DearScholar in your academic research project? 
* Contact the main author (p.m.kruyen@fm.ru.nl) for credentials (username and password); download the app on the App Store or Google Play; take your time to test the app; send us feedback, and discuss with us how to implement DearScholar in your project :rocket:.

* For iOS devices (iPhones and iPads), download the app on [the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dearscholar/id1483121589?ls=1);
* For Android devices, download the app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.peterkruyen.diary&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1).

* Currently, the official deployed version of DearScholar stores research data on a secure server in the Netherlands only. If you want to use your own server, contact the main author to discuss how to make this possible.

## Current research projects
DearScholar is used in the following projects:
* Diary study on public servants' creativity (>50 respondents; February-December 2020) by Glenn Houtgraaf MSc, dr. Peter M. Kruyen, and prof. dr. Sandra van Thiel.
* Diary study on creativity in local-care teams (>150 respondents; September-December 2020) by Liesbeth Faas MSc, dr. Peter M. Kruyen, and prof. dr. Sandra van Thiel.

# Current features
## Let respondents install DearScholar on their mobile device
1) A respondent has to download DearScholar from the App Store (iPhones and iPads) or Google Play (Android devices);
2) When opening DearScholar for the first time (left screenshot below), a respondent is asked to: 
    * allow push notifications; 
    * fill out the username and password that (s)he has received from the researcher; 
    * choose a 4-digit PIN if the device does not support Touch ID or Face Recognition; and 
    * agree to the informed consent form.
3) When everything goes well, DearScholar pulls the required survey tables and settings from the server, and the respondent is directed to the measurement schedule (homepage, right screenshot below).

## Let respondents answer questions
When logging in to DearScholar, a respondent is directed to the measurement schedule (homepage) with all measurement occasions (dates). Future measurement occasions—measurement occasions beyond the current date—are locked and marked with a 'closed lock' icon. 

When a respondent clicks on a particular measurement occasion in the measurement schedule, (s)he is directed to a survey screen that displays all survey modules for that measurement date. Each module can be opened by clicking on the designated icon (see the screenshot below).

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img src=https://github.com/pmkruyen/dearscholar/blob/master/screenshots/3.png width="350"/></kbd>
</p>

DearScholar supports an unlimited number of survey modules, unlimited number of question pages in each module, a specification of which questions to appear on which page, simple branching and skipping logic, and different types of questions (binary questions, open questions, multiple-choice items, and rating sliders) to collect both quantitative and qualitative data (see the screenshots below for two examples). Respondents can type their answers in the answer boxes... or--because DearScholar works with speech recognition--dictate their answers.

</p>

When a respondent has completed a module (i.e., for that module, all questions have been answered and the data has been successfully uploaded to the server) the module icon turns green on the survey page. If all mandatory modules have been completed, the link to the measurement occasion turns grey and is marked with a 'sun' icon on the homepage.

DearScholar also includes links to additional, optional survey modules which can be found on the homepage's menu. Respondents can start these additional modules in between measurement occasions to report their thoughts once they occur (cf. event-sampling).

Respondents’ answers are not only send to a server, but also saved in the DearScholar. Respondents can access their previous answers by clicking on completed measurement modules, facilitating respondents to keep track of, and reread their own responses.

## Push notifications
DearScholar can be used with Google's Firebase to get the push notifications working *or* alternatively, a private push notification server can be used (using Node.JS for example). Contact the main author for advice on setting up such a server.

## Additional features
DearScholar has the capacity to send short in-app messages to specific respondents. For example, respondents can be sent thank-you messages to show engagement, small encouragements when respondents have missed a measurement occasions, ask follow-up questions, or invited respondents to elaborate on particular answers over the phone or through email. These in-app messages are displayed on a separate message screen. An envelope icon appears in the app’s status bar when new messages have been sent. When respondents have read the message, the researcher is noted.
