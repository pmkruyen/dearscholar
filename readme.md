# Overview
Because collecting longitudinal data becomes more important in academic research nowadays and because limitations with available tools, DearScholar has been developed.

DearScholar allows researchers to easily and orderly collect rich and diverse qualitative and quantitative data over short and long periods of time to answer research questions about inter- and intra-individual changes, developments, and processes.

Developed as hybrid app in Cordova/Phonegap (using html, javascript, and css), DearScholar can be used to collect data on iOS devices (iPhones and iPads), Android devices, and--in the future--in web browsers too.

## Interested in using DearScholar in your academic research project? 
* Contact the main author (p.m.kruyen@fm.ru.nl) for credentials (username and password); download the app on the App Store or Google Play (see the links below); take your time to test the app; and send us feedback :rocket:.

* Currently, the offical version of DearScholar stores research data on a secure server in the Netherlands only. If you want to use DearScholar in real projects *and* use your own server, contact the main author to discuss how to make this possible.

## Interested in contributing to DearScholar?
Super cool. Please contact the main author to discuss issues and possibilities. 

## Your own version of DearScholar?
Obviously, as this is an open-source project, you are free to build your own derivative version (clone) of DearScholar. However, while DearScholar clones might be allowed on Google Play, submisions of clones run the risk of being rejected on the App Store due to Apple's policies. More importantly, combining our strengths to develop DearScholar further will be more productive for the research community and more fun! Thank you! :smiley:.
