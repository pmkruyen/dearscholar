# Summary 
Increasingly, scholars in the social and behavioral sciences prefer longitudinal data over cross-sectional data to explore new research phenomena, test effects, and build theories about *between* and, especially *within* individual differences over time. Indeed, top-tier journals in, among others, management, psychology, and organization science nowadays tend to reject studies in which no longitudinal data has been used to investigate causal relations (e.g., Bono & McNamara, 2011; De Jonge, 2011; Rico, 2013), in particular when testing mediation effects (cf. Kline, 2015). 

Diary studies are one particular class of research methods in which “self-report instruments [are] used repeatedly …  to investigate social, psychological, and physiological processes, within everyday situations…”  (Bolger et al., 2003: 578). While there is a rich tradition of diary studies (cf. Iida, Shrout, Laurenceau, & Bolger, 2012; Ohly, Sonnentag, Niessen, & Zapf, 2010), these methods are used relatively infrequently to collect data compared to other methods such as experiments, panel studies, and archival research. Given the administrative burden of diary studies for both respondents (research participants) and researchers, their relative unfamiliarity (or unpopularity) is understandable.

DearScholar, is a hybrid smartphone application that can be used on iOS devices (iPhones and Ipads) and Android devices (basically all other smartphones and tablets) to conduct diary studies. DearScholar's aim is to facilitate the administration process of diary studies for both respondents and researchers (and , obviously, can also be used for other types of longitudinal research such as repeated-survey designs and log studies). Researchers only have to specify measurement occassions (measurement schedule), the survey layout, and specific questions. Respondents have to download the app on the App Store or Google Play, fill out their credentials, and start participating.

# Alternatives
Currently, there is a limited number of (commercial) diary research apps available, including (Indeemo)[indeemo.com], LifeData (lifedatacorp.com). PIEL Survey (pielsurvey.org), Open Data Kit (opendatakit.org), RedCap (projectredcap.org), and Teamscope (teamscopeapp). Acknowledging their value, some target the researcher as primary respondent instead of research participants; some are rather expensive for (large-scale) projects and make it difficult to change diary tasks during the study period; some are especially designed to collect exclusively qualitative data or quantitative data for one particular type of platform, and—last but not least—some store data outside the European Union, which is problematic for European researchers.
