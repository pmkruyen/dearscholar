# Background 
Increasingly, scholars in the social and behavioral sciences prefer longitudinal data over cross-sectional data to explore new research phenomena, test effects, and build theories. Indeed, top-tier journals in, among others, management, psychology, and organization science nowadays tend to reject studies in which no longitudinal data has been used to investigate causal relations (e.g., [@Bono: 2011]; [@Jonge: 2011], [@Rico: 2013]), in particular when testing mediation effects (cf. [@Kline,2015]). 

Diary studies are one particular class of research methods in which “self-report instruments [are] used repeatedly …  to investigate social, psychological, and physiological processes, within everyday situations…” ([@Bolger: 2002,578]). While there is a rich tradition of diary studies (cf. [@Iida: 2012]; [@Ohly: 2010]), these methods are used relatively infrequently to collect data compared to other methods such as experiments, panel studies, and archival research. Given the administrative burden of diary studies for both respondents (research participants) and researchers, their relative unfamiliarity (or unpopularity) is understandable.

However, given their potential to obtain a better understanding of both *between* and, especially *within* individual differences over time, scholars across disciplines call for more research in which diary methods are applied, such as in 
in public administration (e.g.,[@Bakker: 2015]; [@Grimmelikhuijsen: 2017]), marketing (e.g., [@Elliott: 2005]), and health research (e.g., [@Jones: 2000]).

# Diary research apps and DearScholar
A limited number of (commercial) diary research apps have been developed, including [Indeemo](https://www.indeemo.com), [LifeData](https://www.lifedatacorp.com/), [PIEL Survey](https://pielsurvey.org/), [Open Data Kit](https://www.opendatakit.org), [RedCap](https://www.projectredcap.org), and [Teamscope](https://www.teamscopeapp.com). Acknowledging their value, some of these apps target the researcher as primary respondent instead of research participants; some are rather expensive for (large-scale) projects and make it difficult to change diary tasks during the study period; some are especially designed to collect qualitative data or quantitative data for one particular type of platform only (often Android only), and—last but not least—some store data outside the European Union, which is problematic for European researchers.

DearScholar, is a hybrid, open-source smartphone application (app) that can be used on iOS devices (iPhones and Ipads) and Android devices (basically all other smartphones and tablets) to conduct diary studies (and, obviously, can also be used for other types of longitudinal research such as repeated-survey designs and log studies). DearScholar's aim is to facilitate the research process for both respondents and researchers taken the limitations of the alternatives for DearScholar into consideration. Researchers only have to specify measurement occassions (measurement schedule),  survey layout, and question format. Respondents have to download the app on the App Store<sup>1</sup> or Google Play<sup>2</sup>, fill out their credentials, and start participating.

# Use cases
Currently, DearScholar is used in a study by Glenn Houtgraaf MSc, dr. Peter M. Kruyen and prof. dr. Sandra van Thiel to investigate work-related creativity in government organizations. We use DearScholar to follow about 100 participants over a period of six months, asking them closed- and open-ended questions at bi-weekly measurement occassions to investigate creative processes. In September and October, Liesbeth Faas MSc, dr. Peter M. Kruyen, adn prof. dr. Sandra van Thiel will replicate this study in local care teams.

# Acknowledgement
The author wants to express his graditute to Glenn Houtgraaf MSc, Liesbeth Faas MSc, and the ICT Services (Radboud University, Nijmegen) for their advice, testing, and feedback; prof. dr. Sandra van Thiel for her encouragements; and last, but not least, all (pilot) respondents for their effort and feedback during the developmental process.
